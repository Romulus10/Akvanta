# Akvanta
## A currently ASCII-based rougelike RPG written in Javascript.
The map displays as a 15x15 grid in the top left hand segment of the screen. So far, the app has only been tested on an iPhone 6. Other screen sizes probably won't work without some modifications to the CSS.
### Map Design
Maps will be varying sizes. The player will only see the 15x15 block around them.
### Map Objects
The current characters that stand for objects are:
X - The player.
! - A trap.
o - An item.
1-10 - An enemy. Higher numbers mean higher difficulty to beat.

# TODO
* Comment all of the JavaScript.
* Write the Wiki.
* Deal with enemy actions.
* Add actions to the buttons.
* Basic game logic.
* Add regions/rooms/areas.
* Write events to both javascript console and game console (top area).
* Add an equipment screen.
* Add an inventory screen.
* Keep data persistent.
